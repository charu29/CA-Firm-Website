## Synopsis

This library will show a de-activation survey dialog when the user clicks "deactivate" on plugins.php on any plugins you've bound the library to. The form data will be posted to ccplugins.co

## Installation

- Copy the files into your project (I recommend using the path /lib/codecabin/plugin-deactivation-survey)
- Include deactivate-feedback-form.php in your plugin
- Run the code below with your plugins slug

## Usage

add_filter('codecabin_deactivate_feedback_form_plugins', function($plugins) {
	
	$plugins[] = (object)array(
		'slug'		=> 'wp-google-maps',
		'version'	=> '7.0.6'
	);
	
	return $plugins;
	
});

## Notes

You can include any other arbitrary data you might want to store in the object you pass to the $plugins array in the example above
